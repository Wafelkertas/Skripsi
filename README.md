## Undergraduate thesis on UIN Jakarta

One day i thought someone in the wild will eat a poisonous mushroom and it will be bad day or last day for him and then i speculate why dont i build a application using
deep neural network to differenciate edible mushroom and not edible mushroom. As fast i can googled this subject what i had found that others already build this model and appliaction 
such as [Deep Shrooms's Project](https://tuomonieminen.github.io/deep-shrooms/) and many more, but whatever i just build it anyway.

### This project using Tensorflow for Deep Neural Network library, selenium as image scrapper, and many python modules or library used
